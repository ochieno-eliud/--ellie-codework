                <p>Floors should be constructed to minimize slipping and bruising due to slippery or uneven floors. Excessively rough
concrete or surfaces with sharp protrusions and stones can cause excessive wear or penetrations to the sole of the hoof,
resulting in lameness. Unsuitable floors may inhibit mounting behaviours and lead to injuries. Protective floor
coverings (eg rubber matting or other nonslip surfaces) can be used on walkways to reduce hoof abrasions that lead to
secondary hoof infections.</p>
                <p><b><i>4.2.6 Protect animals from injury and distress during loading and unloading and<br>
                        provide appropriate condition for transport</i></b><br></p>
            <br><h2><b>4.3 Ensure animals are free from pain, injury and disease</b></h2><br>
                <p><b><i>4.3.1 Have an effective herd health management programme in place and inspect
<br>animals regularly</i></b><br></p>
                <p><b><i>4.3.2 Do not use procedures and processes that cause unnecessary pain</i></b><br>
People carrying out veterinary related tasks should be able to demonstrate competency, especially for procedures that
could cause suffering for example disbudding/dehorning, castration, etc. Adhere to national regulations with respect to
these and other practices (such as hot branding, tail docking, teat amputations, etc). Good hygiene is essential for
surgical-type procedures. Consider alternative animal husbandry practices if appropriate</p>
                <p><b><i>4.3.3 Follow appropriate birthing and weaning practices</i></b><br></p>

            <br><h2><b>4.4 Ensure animals are free from fear</b></h2><br>
                <p><b><i>4.4.1 Consider animal behavior when developing farm infrastructure and herd management routines</i></b><br>
Good design of facilities to take advantage of the natural behaviors of dairy animals can
enhance the movement of animals, reducing the number of negative interactions required
by the stock handlers. Quiet, consistent handling practices using well designed facilities
promote better productivity and safety from reduced fear and stress.</p>
                <p><b><i>4.4.2 Provide competent stock handling and husbandry skills and appropriate
<br>training</i></b><br>A competent operator should be able to:</p>

                    <li>understand the significance of a change in the behaviour of the animals;</li>
                    <li>know when veterinary treatment is required;</li>
                    <li>implement a planned herd health management programme, such as preventive treatments or vaccination <br>programmes
when necessary;</li>
                    <li>implement appropriate animal feeding and grassland management programmes;</li>
                    <li>recognize if the general environment (indoors or outdoors) is adequate to promote good health and welfar</li>
                    <li>have management skills appropriate to the scale and technical requirements of the production system;</li>
                    <li>handle animals compassionately and in an appropriate manner and anticipate potential problems and<br> take the
necessary preventive action.</li>

        <br><h1><b>6. SOCIO-ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT</b></h1><br><br>
        <p>Managing and looking after the farm’s human resources is critical to the sustainability of the enterprise.</p>
        <br><h2><b>5.2 Have an appropriate waste management system</b></h2><br>    
        <p><b><i>6.1.1 Implement sustainable work practices</i></b><br></p>
                <p><b><i>6.1.2 Employ staff based on national laws and practice</i></b><br>
                Farm staff should be engaged on clearly defined and documented terms. Labour productivity is enhanced when dairy
staff properly understand their duties, so a documented job
description can be useful.</p>
                <p><b><i>6.1.3 Manage human resources effectively ensuring that their working conditions comply with applicable laws and
international conventions</i></b><br></p>
                <p><b><i>6.1.4 Ensure the farm working environment complies with relevant occupation health and safety requirements</i></b><br></p>
            <br><h2><b>6.2 Ensure farm tasks are carried out safely and competently</b></h2><br> 
                <p><b><i>6.2.1 Have appropriate procedures and equipment in place for undertaking dairy farming tasks</i></b><br></p>

                <p><b><i>6.2.4 Choose competent people for training, advice and interventions</i></b><br></p>
                <br><h2><b>6.3 Manage the enterprise to ensure its financial viability</b></h2><br>
                <p><b><i>.3.1 Implement financial management systems</i></b><br>
                Most decisions that support good dairy farming practice have financial implications for the farm enterprise. Use records
and book keeping systems that can provide the dairy farmer with up to date information about the farm’s financial
position. Access to this information underpins good decision-making.</p>
                <p><b><i>6.3.2 Adopt agricultural practices that contribute to the productivity and/or profitability goals of the enterprise</i></b><br></p>
                <p><b><i>6.3.3 Plan ahead to manage financial risks</i></b><br></p>
